## Design

### Icon
There will two types of icons used for this webpage: 
* [Favicon](https://favicon.io/ "Favicon") will be used as a website identifier, this identifier will be visible on the tab and if the website is bookmarked. A favicon is important as it will give the brand recognition and therefore will make the page more identifiable. 
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome") will be used for the three categories of difficulty. Furthermore, universal icons will be used meaning the overall user experience will be improved. 

### Font
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") was used to identify which font would best suit a quiz show. I decided to use the **Rubik** font as it's clear, modern and simplistic. This font will be used for all elements.

### Colour Scheme
The below colour scheme was generated using [Coolor](https://coolors.co/ "Coolers"). Mild and calming colours are used in this quiz as it provides a welcoming feel for the user. Furthermore Complimentary colours are used throughout to marry all the colours together. 
![Colour Scheme](docs/screenshots/ColourScheme.png "Colour Scheme")

| Colour  | Description |
| ------  | --- |
| #463F3A | This colour will be used for the header bar |
| #8A817C | This colour will be used for the all buttons |
| #040303 | This colour will be used for the text within the quiz. |
| #E0AFA0 | This colour will be used for the answer box. |
| #F4F3EE | This colour will be used for the background and as contrasting text. |
| #256125 | This colour will be used to indicate that the user has answered the question correctly. |
| #d31717 | This colour will be used to indicate that the user has answered the quesiton incorrectly. |


### Breakpoints
No particular breakpoints will be used in the media queries however, the website is responsive to a minimum of 320px. 


### Wireframes
Three wireframes shown below are examples of what the content of the page will look like when displayed on large and small screens. The page will be designed in order to be responsive to all sizes and therefore the large screen and medium screen will exhibit the same presentation with proportional scale. Both wireframes were created using [Mockplus RP](https://www.mockplus.com/mockplus-rp "Mockplus RP").

## Features

## Bug Fixes
| Bug detected | Action |
|--|--|
| When testing using a mobile device, the hover colour of answers clicked remained active | Hover effects and properties were added to media query. |
| Outer parts of the box when clicked doesn't register as a click to the answer | Upon investigation it was discovered that it was due to the transform effect added, this was changed to make it still feel like a button is being clicked but make sure even if the outer most elements are chosen, the click is still registered.  |

## Potential Future Additions
* With more resource and time, I would like to add a feature whereby when the incorrect answer is selected, the correct answer is also shown.
* With more resource and time, I would like to add more category specific questions to the quiz.
* With more resource and time, I would like to add an interface whereby scores can be stored and shared with others
